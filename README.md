# automated_grocery_list_generator

  I have a list of recipes my family uses a lot.  My goal is to enter those recipes into a list, click a button that extends a shopping list and then counts the number of items you need to buy based on the number of items needed. So far, I can copy and paste the recipes and there is no GUI.  I would also like to do various things like turn the shopping list into a file and have the users add a recipe --or better yet find a way to automate the recipe uploads. 
  
  I also would like to write a cookbook that accompanies the software.
